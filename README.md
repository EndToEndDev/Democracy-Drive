This Python script implements a GUI-driven server application that allows users to ask a question, collect responses, and store the data in an XML file. The code integrates several libraries, including `customtkinter` for the GUI, `http.server` for running an HTTP server, and `xml.etree.ElementTree` for handling XML data. The application allows the user to define a question, set a timer, and start/stop a server that hosts a simple web page where users can input their answers.

The `append_to_xml()` function handles saving user responses to an XML file. It checks if the file exists, parses it, and appends the new data. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new XML structure. The data is formatted and prettified using `xml.dom.minidom`, and unnecessary blank lines are removed before writing the updated XML back to the file.

The `start_server()` function starts an HTTP server on a dynamically assigned port between 8000 and 8080. It serves an HTML form where users can submit answers to a question. The server is designed to display a countdown timer and provides the option to stop the server. The server runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main GUI, ensuring a responsive interface.

The HTML page served by the server includes a question, a text area for input, a submit button, and a timer indicating the remaining time for submitting a response. JavaScript functions are used to handle real-time input resizing and timer updates. The server responds to both GET and POST requests, although POST functionality is not fully implemented in this example.

To manage the countdown timer, the `update_timer()` function is used. It decreases the timer by one second every time the server handles a request, updating the GUI's status label to show the remaining time. Once the timer reaches zero, the server is automatically stopped by setting a shutdown event. This event is also used to disable user inputs and buttons when the server shuts down.

The GUI is created using `customtkinter`, which is a modern alternative to standard Tkinter that provides a dark mode aesthetic. It includes input fields for the question, host IP, and timer duration, as well as buttons to start and stop the server. When the server is running, the status label updates with the server’s IP and port, and the start/stop buttons toggle their state accordingly.

The server’s IP and port can be configured by the user, with a default value of "192.168.1.80" for the host. When the user clicks the "Start Server" button, the `on_start_button_click()` function is called, which validates the input, generates a random port, and starts the server in a new thread. It also disables the start button and enables the stop button.

When the "Stop Server" button is clicked, the `on_stop_button_click()` function sets the `stop_event`, which stops the server by breaking out of the request-handling loop. The server is gracefully shut down, and the submit button and response textbox are disabled to prevent further interaction.

Finally, the `start_gui()` function is the entry point of the application, which sets up the GUI, initializes the events, and starts the Tkinter event loop. This function is called when the script is executed as the main program, ensuring that the GUI and server are properly initialized. The overall goal is to facilitate a simple server-based interaction for collecting and storing responses.
